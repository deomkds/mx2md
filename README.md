# mx2md
Extract notes from Memorix Backup files (*.mxbk).

[Memorix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=panama.android.notes) is a note-taking application for Android devices.

This script extracts notes from a Memorix backup and saves them as Markdown files.
- Notes are organized into subfolders based on their assigned categories.
- Synced notes are tracked using a database, enabling incremental syncs.
- You can use folders as input: the script will select the most recent backup file from within the folder.

# Usage
```
python3 mx2md.py -i [input file or folder] -o [output folder] [options]
```

# Example
This script allows you to maintain a copy of your Memorix notes as Markdown files. Hereâ€™s one way to use it:
1. Setup Memorix to make periodic backups.
2. Sync those backups to a PC using a cloud provider like OneDrive or Google Drive.
3. Pass the folder containing the backups as input to `mx2md`.
4. Run `mx2md` periodically to output the Markdown files to a more permanent folder.

`mx2md` uses a JSON database to track synced files. It automatically detects and updates modified notes in the destination folder and deletes notes that have been removed from Memorix, effectively keeping a local mirror. This setup is useful if you want your notes accessible in more advanced note-taking apps like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

# Limitations
Currently, `mx2md` cannot:
- Extract notes stored in the Vault, and this is unlikely to change.
- Maintain information about reminders.

# License
`mx2md` is licensed under a 2-clause BSD license.
